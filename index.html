          <p class="main-text">
            First time I came to Asia was in ‚Äô16 when I went to study in Singapore with the help of my uni. Got hooked ever since. 
            <br />
            <br />
            My current alma mater includes Essec Buisness school and the Guanghua, Beijing university. I have pervious marketing-related experience in tech, but I am looking forward to break into in the operations side of things.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here is the list of technologies I am confident with enough to call myself knowledgeable:
          </p>
          <ul class="main-text" id="list-blue">
            <li> Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Pytorch)</li>
            <li> SQl (Mainly MySql)</li>
            <li> Web-related technologies (HTML, Javascript, CSS)</li>
          </ul>

  	<div class="container">
  		<h2> <span class="main-title-number"> 02.</span> <span class="main-title">Chinese tech companies</span></h2>
  				<p class="main-text">
  					This is where I talk about my research topic, ‚Äúinternationalization strategies of Chinese technology companies within western Europe‚Äù. It is a huge effort, spanning over 60 pages.
            <br /> 
            So far I‚Äôve only scratched the surface, but it seems that Chinese software companies prefer to acquire existing companies with a solid user-base (Tik Tok purchased musical.ly) to either penetrate western audiences or in some rarer cases penetrate emerging market audiences (Weidong Cloud Education purchased Brest business school to sell online French business courses in northern Africa).

  		<h2> <span class="main-title-number"> 03.</span> <span class="main-title">Public Policy</span></h2>

  				<p class="main-text">	
  					Good economic policy has its own beauty to it. In this case, Asia's tech scene could have never risen without the appropriate backing from local governments. While we are quick to cite the successes of Chinese start-ups like Alibaba and Tencent, there are also some interesting developments in SE asian countries like Indonesia with Gojek and Traveloka. I intend in the near future to blog about these specific policies on Medium.

  					I've alwyas tried to reconcile what was a priori 2 vastly different interests. It turns out to be project and operations management! You always need to keep learning to succed. It's all about delivery and the fun in between.
